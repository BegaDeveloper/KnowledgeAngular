# I have made this project to showcase some of my code and knowledge.

# 1. Simple Login auth., with quard, logger service and routes that unlocks other pages when logged in.

# 2. A Form that gets input values, validates them with "Angular Validators".

# 3. Some HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

# 4. And a list of items that I got from a service with DI and showcase it into a table in the HTML.
